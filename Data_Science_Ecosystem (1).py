# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# #### Objectives
# 
# Some of the key take aways from this course are:
# 
#  -List the languages used by data scientists.
#  
#  -List the commonly used libraries that data scientists use.
#  
#  -Create a table using jupiter notebook.
#  
#  -Perform mathematical computations and expressions.
#  
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[20]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[21]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
# Total Number of minutes TM = 200
# Minutes per Hour, mph= 60
# Converting minutes to hours , minutes_to_hours

(200/60)
